  <li><a href="http://geacron.com/home-en/">Link to Interactive History Map.</a> Very informative and ideal for what it aims to present, but could use a graphical update. </li>
  <li><a href="https://academo.org/demos/3d-surface-plotter/">Link to 3D Surface plotter.</a> Simple and intuitive to use, but with few customisation options. </li>

     <li> <h2>Elmir Mahammadov: </h2> Planning to visualize a biological pathway(a graph object) that would be obtained from an online database (e.g. KEGG)</li>
     <li> <h2> Ioannis Chrysostomakis: </h2> I would like to visualise and analyse genetic data from different species 
through time (maybe including a way similar to the history map above) to be able to understand the way natural selection(or lack thereof) has affected those species.
The visualisation should showcase trends and groups and their genetic distance and show how they differ from each other. This would be of interest to population geneticist and the public alike. </li> 
     <li> <h2> Dimitris Chouliaras: </h2> I anticipate to visualize the different types of cancer and its new occurrences on the world wide map, as well as their mortality rates;
     the average basic income of each country and the corresponding costs of cancer treatment should also be available.</li>
