       <h3><li>Elmir Mahammadov, question 3.2: </h3> Instead of one plot with averages of each year, we can use streamograph with a button where a button named 'next' could visualise how temperatures changed for each month for each year.</li>
       <h3><li>Ioannis Chrysostomakis, question 3.1: </h3></li> 
       <h3><li>Dimitris Chouliaras, question 3.3: </h3> The rendering of the visual elements representing the data is an important limiting factor. In case of large datasets we can spilt them or pull the data of particular interest. Another options is to reduce the dimensionality of data with machine learning techniques such as PCA (Principle component analysis). In this case human understanding of the meaning of the dimensions extracted is the key to success. An example of constantly expanding dataset visualization is the visualization  of live Tweets all over the world. This is a special case of continuously delivered data. The Data transformation should be fast, otherwise  the data displayed will not be coherent with time. The most recent changes should be highlighted.</li>
